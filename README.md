# PHY224-Practical-Physics
Repo containing code/data for experiments conducted in a practical physics course.
The following lists experiments conducted (updated throughout term):

  -> Radioactive Decay
    - Conducted analysis of decay data from a sample of Barium 137m.
    - Plotted findings with errorbars.
    - Used Numpy and Scipy to perform linear regressions and determined reduced chi squared values.
    
  -> Ohm and Power Laws
