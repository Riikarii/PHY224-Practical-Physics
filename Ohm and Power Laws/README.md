Brief description of the Ohm and Power Laws experiment:

- Built electronic circuits to measure the current voltage flowing through a resistor or a light bulb.
- Collected data based on multimeter readings of voltages and currents.
- Performed linear and nonlinear regressions on data to determine optimal parameters for curves of best fit.
- Plotted findings on log-log scales and compared the various best fit curves.
- Calculated reduced chi squared from parameters.
- Wrote up the analysis in a comprehensive lab report.
